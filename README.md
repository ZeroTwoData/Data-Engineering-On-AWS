# Data Engineering FAQ's

## What Is the Purpose of Data Engineering?

Data Engineering is the process of making data usable for the business, by making it accessible for data customers (BI Analysts, Data Analysts, Data Scientists, etc.) who will ultimately analyze this data for business needs. Data customers are only able to access data, after a data engineer has built a system in which they can retrieve the data from. These systems, specifically referred to as "data pipelines," are an end-to-end process that ingest raw/unorganized data, processes it, prepares it, and finally visualizes the data for the customers to use). I found that the best way to begin designing a pipeline, is to blueprint.

## How Does the DS Blueprint Work

A DS Blueprint will always consist of five phases

In this section, we will look at the main components of our data pipeline.
